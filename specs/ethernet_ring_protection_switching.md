# Ethernet Ring Protection Switching

- ERPS networks can achieve sub-50ms failover. 
- Imagine a large fibre-optic backbone such as a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).
- Where 99.9999% reliability is a requirement.
- ERPS is able to deliver this without compromising the future scalability and growth of such a network. 
- Streaming a large event such as the Olympic Games may have such requirements.

If FreeBSD can be plugged directly into an ERPS network, then pfSense and FreeNAS appliances can deliver services 
without the need to sit behind routers. Picture a redundant Storage Area Network (SAN), serving an entire state or a county, 
without requiring expensive hardware load balancers. ERPS will make this and other things possible.
